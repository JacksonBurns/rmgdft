# -----------
#
# This module tries to find the rocBLAS library.
#
# The following variables are set
#
# ::
#
#   ROCBLAS_FOUND           - True if rocblas is found
#   ROCBLAS_LIBRARIES       - The required libraries
#   ROCBLAS_INCLUDE_DIRS    - The required include directory
#   ROCBLAS_HAS_SGEMM       - Support for sgemm
#   ROCBLAS_HAS_DGEMM       - Support for dgemm
#   ROCBLAS_HAS_CGEMM       - Support for cgemm
#   ROCBLAS_HAS_ZGEMM       - Support for zgemm
#
# The following import target is created
#
# ::

This subdirectory actually contains a stripped down version of scalapack and lapack for use in RMG. The reason for doing this is that RMG will frequently be used on clusters that have non-standard configurations with multiple versions of these libraries built for different compilers and mpi implementations. Users often have a very difficult time getting the code to build cleanly because of mismatched library versions and this stripped down internal version should make this process much simpler.
